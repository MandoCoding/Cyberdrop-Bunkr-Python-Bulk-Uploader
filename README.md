# Cyberdrop-Bunkr-Lolisafe-Python-Uploader

It works, more than I ever expected. There's still a lot to do:
- Check for and create /Uploads/ directory
- Error Handling (album already exists = album ID fail right now)
- batch file to install pre-requisites
- Write Uploaded album urls to file for easy posting :EZ:
- Tidy up the prints 
- Tidy up everything
- Show upload progress - basic version is number of files, fancy version is scroll bar
- Parallel uploads?


Many thanks to Marcus' lolisafe bash script
