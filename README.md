# Cyberdrop-Bunkr-Lolisafe-Python-Uploader

It works, more than I ever expected. There's still a lot to do:
- Allow updates to folders
- Error Handling - No folders to upload
- batch file to install pre-requisites
- Tidy up the prints 
- Tidy up variables
- Improve upload progress to fill bar
- Parallel uploads?
- Create exe



Many thanks to Marcus' lolisafe bash script



Done:
- Check for and create /Uploads/ directory
- Close out line "Uploads complete, press enter etc..."
- Show upload progress - basic version is number of files
- Error Handling (album already exists = album ID fail right now)
- Write Uploaded album urls to file for easy posting :EZ:
